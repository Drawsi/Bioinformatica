======================
Bioinformatics project
======================

**Goals:**
  * Making a program to ease the use of currently developed algorithms.

**Current work-ons:**
  * Finishing the STAR information storing algorithm.
  * Starting work on the BEAR model created by Adrian Beteringhe.
 
**Additional information:**
  - The documentation will probably be the last thing I'll work on unless the demand is high enough that it takes priority.
  - I plan on using this as my university thesis therefore further development will be necesarry.
